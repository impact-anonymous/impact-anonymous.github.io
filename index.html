 1.	We admitted we were powerless over the Impact Factor - that our lives had become unmanageable.

 2.	Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.

 3.	Made a decision to turn our will and our lives and our citations over to the care of the Hiring Authority as we understood it.

 4.	Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves, and the journals we submitted to.

 5.	Admitted to the Hiring Authority, to ourselves and to another research the exact nature of our wrongs, and our submission errors

 6.	Were entirely ready to have the Hiring Authority remove all these defects of metrics from our CV.

 7.	Humbly asked Them to remove our impact factor.

 8.	Made a list of all journals we had submitted to, and articles we had neglected, and became willing to judge them on their merits alone.

 9.	Made direct amends to such articles wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.

 10. Continued to take personal inventory (but not a personal impact factor) and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.

 11.	 Sought through citation and reading to improve our conscious contact with Impact as we understood IT, seeking only for knowledge for it's own sake, and the power to carry that search out.

 12.	 Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to researchers and to practice these principles in all our affairs.
